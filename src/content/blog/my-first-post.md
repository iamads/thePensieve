I am writing this post 26 Aug 24/

Recently I have built a system for workouts by doing it for 100 days. Sometimes doing it really well and sometimes just barely doing it/

But I have become consistent for it and important thing is that I look forward to my workouts.

Looking into it I realise there were reasons why it was successful

- The task in itself was easy to do...If I had no energy I could do 20 min walk and I would call it successful and on good days I would do two workouts.
- I had options: Badminton, gym, swim, running and walk, when I got bored with something I went ahead and picked up something else.
- I had somnething to look out for : KGL trek

Things that didn't went well

- Inititally got a good routine but it got fucked many times due to weekend shenanigans
- Felt a bit bored during times
- The level up around 50 days to track deficit was not very successful .

There are lot of things which I want to do. Let's track some of them here - the bucket list

Next thing I want to do is to Create tech content for 100 days, along with job & workouts etc

It should involve work on two things

- Knowledge Aquistion
- Build Shit

I want to publish one piece of content

- It can be a reel or
- It can be a blog post
- linkedin post
- story
- tutorial
- anything

Let me think on how to execute this!
